# RL Project: Highway

## Assignment context

In this project I will train an agent to navigate on a highway, and hopefully avoid crashing. The OpenAI Gymnasium environment is called [HighwayEnv](https://github.com/Farama-Foundation/HighwayEnv) and is made by [Farama-Foundation](https://github.com/Farama-Foundation/).

## Contents of this repository

In this repository you will find all of the .ipynb notebooks and datasets for a project I had for the course **Reinforcement Learning**.

## Folder structure

### Files

1. `main.ipynb` contains all the code for the models

### Models

`/models/` contains all the models (saved as `.keras`)

1. `~/dqn_model.keras` contains the DQN model
2. `~/dqn_sb3_model.keras` contains the DQN model made with `stable_baselines3`
3. `~/ppo_sb3_model.keras` contains the PPO model made with `stable_baselines3`

### Training Videos

`/videos/` contains all the models (saved as `.mp4`)

1. `~/DQN/` contains the training videos for the DQN model
2. `~/DQN-stable-baselines3/` contains the training videos for the DQN model made with `stable_baselines3`
3. `~/PPO-stable-baselines3` contains the training videos for the PPO model made with `stable_baselines3`

**BONUS**. `~/random` contains the training video where the agent randomly picks actions from the action space. Spoiler, it's terribe :)
